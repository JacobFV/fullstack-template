- for each model:
  - make sure we are only returning the minimum connected nested field values on read, otherwise we could end up with cyclic deps during quiery JSONification
  - put the other schema deps in an if TYPE_CHECKING enclosure so we can keep the imports clean
  - move all crud routers to their api files
  - set view_privileges and update_privileges on all relevant fields
- global context object instead of user/session/etc contexts
- OpenAPI Spec
- unit tests (find an AI to write, run, and debug)
