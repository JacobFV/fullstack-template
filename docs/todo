<p> User comes her and clicks the type of site they have and we provide an embeddable form </p>

<p> If employers want to keep Tabs on employees and make sure work is being done without 100% automation, GOTCHA will be in place </p>

</p> Possibly we can provide some sort of incentive to the employee that if they would rather use AI instead of do the work click skip GOTCHA </p>


- GOTCHA WORKSPACES (FUTURE STUFF)

</p> This could be an alternative to GOTCHA which is a simple way to remove an employees access to company software and tooling to prevent data leaks </p>

<p> You sometimes might forget to remove a certain tool from an employee, we could hae GOTCHA WORKSPACES which manage which tooling an employee is using and remove access with one click based on updated poliices </p>
