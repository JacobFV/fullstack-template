Update Docs for real docs on docs.verifiyhumans.com

- Introduction 

<p> How to generate an API key </p>


- Embeddable Forms 

<p> User comes her and clicks the type of site they have and we provide an embeddable form </p>


- GOTCHA VERIFICATION

<p> This will be an extension of GOTCHA that we can provide to replace One Verify on platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter. </p> 

<p> We provide a state of art verification system that can detect any anomolies in some copying someone elses likeness


- GOTCHA WORKSPACES (FUTURE STUFF)

<p> If employers want to keep Tabs on employees and make sure work is being done without 100% automation, GOTCHA will be in place </p>

</p> Possibly we can provide some sort of incentive to the employee that if they would rather use AI instead of do the work click skip GOTCHA </p>

</p> Should be possible with embeddable forms/integrations

</p> This could be an alternative to GOTCHA which is a simple way to remove an employees access to company software and tooling to prevent data leaks </p>

<p> You sometimes might forget to remove a certain tool from an employee, we could hae GOTCHA WORKSPACES which manage which tooling an employee is using and remove access with one click based on updated poliices </p>
